# max-interview
This is my first work-from-home internship where I worked as a content writer/developer at Max Interview, which provides various coding interview questions along with their detailed algorithm analysis and working codes in different languages.
The website is www.maxinterview.com 

The articles included in this repository are mostly written by me and some of the articles are the one's that I proof-read. I also converted the content into JSON format.
So along with working as a Content Writer, I also did a fair amount of JSON Scripting.
